# S&P 500 Predictive Analysis


## Introduction:
---
The S&P 500 is one of the most widely followed equity indices in the world, reflecting the performance of 500 large companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. Companies are periodically added and removed. This project aims to predict potential changes based on financial indicators.

## Problem Statement:
---
Predict which companies will be in the S&P 500

## Data Collection:
---
We will be sourcing our data from Alpha Vantage, focusing on:

* 1000 stocks
* Quarterly earnings (net income) for the last 8 quarters.
* Monthly trading volume for the past 12 months.
* Market Capitalization.
* Time since the oldest data (an approximation for time since IPO or listing).
* Market Sentiment (NLP Piece)

## Models and Approach:
---
1. Predicting the Next 3 Monthly Trading Volumes:
    a. Data Preparation:

        *Arrange the trading volumes of each stock as sequences of the last 24 periods.
        *The target variable would be sequences of the next 3 periods.
        *Each row in the dataset will look something like: [v1, v2, ..., v24] -> [v25, v26, v27].

    b. Model Selection:

        *For this problem, neural networks or regression-based models can work effectively.
        *LSTM can also be used, given its ability to remember sequences.
        *Another approach is to treat each future month as a separate regression problem. That is, predict v25 based on [v1, v2, ..., v24], then v26, and so on.

    c. Model Evaluation:

        *Metrics like MAE, RMSE to evaluate the regression performance.
        
2. Predicting the Next Quarterly Net Income:
    a. Data Preparation:

        * Arrange the net incomes of each stock as sequences of the last 8 quarters.
        * The target variable would be the value of the next quarter.
        * Each row in the dataset will look something like: [q1, q2, ..., q8] -> q9.

    b. Model Selection:
    
        * Similar to the trading volumes, we can use regression models or neural networks.
        * Since it's just one future value, simple regression models like Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees, or linear regression can be effective.
    c. Model Evaluation:

        * Metrics like MAE, RMSE to evaluate the regression performance.      

3. Classification Based on Predicted Values:
Once wehave the predicted values:

    a. Data Preparation:

        * Integrate the predicted values with our existing features.
        * Label the current S&P 500 stocks as '1' and the rest as '0'.
        
    b. Model Selection & Evaluation:

        * Follow the steps mentioned in the previous response to classify stocks as potential inclusions or exclusions from the S&P 500.

## Hypotheses to Test:
---
* Companies with declining quarterly earnings over consecutive quarters are more likely to be delisted.
* Younger companies (based on our approximation of time since listing) are less likely to be added unless they have significant market capitalization or trading volumes.
* A company's market capitalization and trading volume relative to others might be strong indicators of its likelihood to be added or removed.

By the end of this project, we aim to provide an insightful analysis that can serve as a guiding tool for investors and market enthusiasts to anticipate the future composition of the S&P 500.
